#meta


So, you know all that client information you need to keep track of, like passwords and servers? Or how about all those serial keys for the software you have? meta is a webapp to organize these kinds of data for easier reference.

##Organizing Data

Meta has a four-level hierarchy

1. Genre
	* The broadest category. An example could be titled 'Client Data'
2. Category
	* A general item in the genre. For example, an individual client.
3. Section
	* A grouping of label-data pairs. Something like 'CMS Access'
4. Data
	* Pairs of labels and values.

		Eg. Username : admin


This basic hierarchy enables keeping track of simple data in a neat fashion.
